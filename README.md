# LMFLS
Local Multi-Factor Node Scoring and Label Selection-based Algorithm for Community Detection in Social Networks 

This code implements LMFLS algorithm, a fast and non-overlapping community detection algorithm in Python 3.10.

We have used neighboring list structure as the input file for algorithm. The execution of the LMFLS is so simple.it is only needed to write the name of the dataset to run the algorithm.

Everything is built to run the algorithm (such as pathes to folders and files) and it is only needed to put the extracted folders of: "datasets","groundtruth" in one folder with the source code.
